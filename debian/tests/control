# Run the upstream test suite, which runs crun to spawn containers, and thus
# needs an isolated machine rather than a container, to avoid
# container-in-container limitations.
#
# A build is needed, for tests/init, which requires config.h to be built.
#
# The suite, like crun, can run both with and without root, with different
# codepaths being exercised in each (and with some tests skipped). Thus we run
# the suite twice, once with sudo.
